Whole file source reads the entire file. It's highly recommended not
to use this plugin when the files are very large and splittable.

## Plugin Configuration

| Configuration | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :----- | :---------- |
| **Input Path** | **N** | 1 | Specifies path to a file or collection of files. |

## Usage Notes

If a path specified is a directory, then one file is read at a time
and passed along, but if the path specifies a file, then that exact
file is read and passed along.

# Build

```
  git clone https://github.com/hydrator/whole-file-reader.git whole-file-reader

These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/whole-file-source-<version>.jar> config-file <target/whole-file-source-<version>.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'repartitioner-<version>:

    > load artifact target/whole-file-source-<version>.jar config-file target/whole-file-source-<version>.json
